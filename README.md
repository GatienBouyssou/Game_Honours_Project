During this year I made a little game that you can easily play on your computer. You have two versions available. One for linux and one for windows.  

To play this game you first need to download the game by clicking on "Clone or download" and then download zip. 
Then, you need to extract the game from the .zip.

At this point you should have a directory named Game_Honours_project-master. Go in that directory. You will find the game untitled windowsVersionGame.jar.

IF YOU HAVE JAVA installed just double click on the game 
else 
you can download java here :

# How to play the game

**Aim with your mouse**. Often the spells will be casted toward the position of your mouse.
**Right click to move** The player will move directly to the given position. If he encounters a wall he will stop where he is. 
You can use the keys SPACE Q W E R to cast a spell. If you have an AZERTY keyboard the keys are SPACE A Z E R you should not need to change your settings. 

# Game specification

Each spell has a type (FIRE, PLANT OR WATER). Fire spells cancels plant spells that cancels water spells. Autoattack can't be cancelled. 

Depending on the type, the spell may have a special effect.
